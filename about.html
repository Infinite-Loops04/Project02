         <h2> A brief insight to our journey and the creation on this website </h2>
         <p> Cloudspire is an innovative web development project crafted by our dedicated team, Infinite Loops, under the guidance of Mr. Rahul. Our team comprises four talented individuals: Ishita, Viresh, Manroop, and Zainab, each contributing their unique skills to ensure a seamless collaboration. Ishita, serving as the project lead, has been key in initiating team discussions and fostering accountability, while also enhancing the visual aesthetics and developing the jobs.html page. Manroop, proficient in CSS, has focused on creating an engaging style.css and made significant contributions to the apply.html page, along with managing project pages on GitHub and Jira for effective teamwork. Viresh has laid the groundwork by creating a comprehensive blueprint of the project requirements, leading the development of the index.html page, and drafting the group agreement template. Lastly, Zainab has led the organization of scrum sprints and timelines on Jira, designed the logo for our website, and developed the about.html page. Together, our team has worked collaboratively to bring Cloudspire to life, showcasing our commitment to excellence and innovation in web development.</p>
